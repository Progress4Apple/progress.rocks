In this post I'll show you how to leverage the simplicity of Apple Reminders to get more done with the 1-3-5 rule:

> On any given day, assume that you can only accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and five small things, and narrow down your to-do list to those nine items. _-_ [_the muse_](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule)

Start your day with the chosen 1 big thing - working towards 3 medium and 5 small things. This way you make sure you accomplish the most important task of the day first, thus avoid getting caught by the [urgency effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/smarter-living/eisenhower-box-productivity-tips.html).

### How to use priorities in Apple Reminders

To implement the 1-3-5 rule, we need a way to flag our tasks as "big", "medium" or "small". In Apple Reminders we use the reminder's priority for this:

**Low (!)** - a "small" thing  
**Medium (!!)** - a "medium" thing  
**High (!!!)** - a "big" thing

How you decide what's "big", "medium" or "small" is up to you. Experience shows you should test your to-dos against several criteria and choose their belonging according to your guts feeling. Here's a brief criteria list to kick things off:

* How much time does the todo costs you to get done?
* How much energy does the item costs you to get done?
* How big is the impact of the task once done?
* For how long are you avoiding to work on the to-do?
* _Insert your personal criteria here ..._

Of course the answers to these questions change over time. So you should revise your tasks regularly.

### Leverage the builtin "Scheduled" list

After you‘ve flagged your todos with priorities it's time to decide when you're going to work on these tasks. For this, simply set a date and time for the reminder. Remember to set only 1 big, 3 medium and 5 small tasks for any given day.

Once you accomplished this, open the „Scheduled“ list of Apple Reminders and you‘ll see the 1-3-5 rule at it‘s finest!

To sum up: We **use priorities together with the ability to set a date and time for any reminder** to end up with a **daily plan in the „Scheduled“ list of Apple Reminders**.
