In this guide I'll cover the basics to kick things off for you, so you 'll get Progress for Apple Reminders to work for you.

#### Meant as addition - not as replacement

Please keep in mind that Progress for Apple Reminders is not meant to replace the stock Apple Reminders app. It is designed to serve as a complementary tool which, once configured, keeps you stay on track. "Doing the work" still takes place in Apple Reminders.

#### Display styles

For every report you can choose between the display styles _progress_ and _remaining_. You can choose whichever you prefer.

##### Display style "progress"

The progress display style is based on what you already achieved. For example: If you have a total of six to-dos in your _ðŸŽ“ Studies_ list and two out of six are done, the report shows that there is a progress of 33%:

##### Display style "remaining"

The remaining display style is based on what you still need to do. For example: If you have a total of six to-dos on your _ðŸŽ“ Studies_ list and two out of six are done, the report shows that there is 66% remaining:

### Let's start...

#### 1. Define your goals

The concept of "reaching goals" is the heart of Progress for Apple Reminders. In consequence the first step to make it actually useful is to define your goals.

##### Here are some examples

â€¢ Finish all to-dos of a given project

â€¢ Finish three to-dos of a given project per week

â€¢ Read everyday

â€¢ ...

#### 2. Create a report to track your progress

Once you defined your goals, it's time to add reports in Progress for Apple Reminders. You should add one report for each goal:

##### Goal: Finish all to-dos of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _ðŸŽ“ Studies_ and your goal is to get everything done. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

_Display style_  
personal taste (see below)

_Period_  
overall

_List_  
ðŸŽ“ Studies

Search term  
none

_Goal_  
all

_Measured according to priority_  
No

##### Finish three to-dos per week of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _ðŸŽ“ Studies_ and your goal is to work on these on a regularly - so you get at least three to-dos done per week. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

_Display style_  
personal taste (see below)

_Period_  
current week

_List_  
ðŸŽ“ Studies

Search term  
none

_Goal_  
3

_Measured according to priority_  
No

##### Read everyday

You're maybe tempted to add a list _Reading_ to Apple Reminders and report on that, like we've done in the two examples above. But hold on a second; If you keep adding one list for each report, you might end up with tons of lists and things can get out of hand fairly quick.

That's why we use a different strategy this time: Let's define a _#read_ tag. Even though Apple Reminders does not support tags natively, we're still able to add it as simple text to every reminder. To track how your doing on your _#read_ tag, we add a report following settings in Progress for Apple Reminders:

_Display style_  
personal taste (see below)

_Period_  
current week

_List_  
_all_

Search term  
_#read_

_Goal_  
7

_Measured according to priority_  
No

##### Get creative

The examples above should give you a feeling for what's possible with Progress for Apple Reminders. Now start defining your goals, add the reports and start beating the bar!

#### Stay engaged with Today-Widgets

To see the progress bars in the Today-Screen, the following conditions have to be met:

##### In the report settings, make sure that:

_Period_  
Either _current week_, _last week_, _current month_, or _last month_ is set.

_Show in Today-Widget_  
Is enabled.

##### In case your report does still not appear in the Today-Widget

Please double check the report settings and make sure you've added Today-Widget corresponding to the reports chosen period.

If you still run into problems, please drop me a line at [support@progress.rocks](mailto:support@progress.rocks)

##### Today-Widget for "overall"

There is no Today-Widget for the _overall_ period right now. This is due to the tight memory limits Today-Widgets have. Iâ€™m still testing if the Today-Widget is guaranteed to work, even if there are tons of reminders in the Reminders app. If the overall Today-Widget is what you are looking for, [please drop me a line](mailto:support@progress.rocks) containing the approximately amount of reminders you add to Apple Reminders per week.
