## Preliminary notes

### Meant as an addition - not as a replacement

Please note Progress for Apple Reminders is not designed to replace the Apple Reminders stock app. It is designed to serve as a complementary tool which, once configured, helps you to stay on track. "Doing the work" still takes place in Apple Reminders.

### Display styles

In Progress for Apple Reminders you're able to choose between the display styles _progress_ and _remaining_. You can choose whichever you prefer.

## 1. Let's start: Define your goals

The concept of "reaching goals" is at the heart of Progress for Apple Reminders. As a consequence the first step you need to do in order to make Progress for Apple Reminders actually useful is to define your goals.

### Here are some examples for such goals

• Finish all to-dos of a given project

• Finish three to-dos of a given project per week

• Read everyday

• ...

## 2. Create a report to track your progress

Once you defined your goals, it's time to add reports in Progress for Apple Reminders. You should add one report for each goal.

### Example: Finish all to-dos of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _Studies_ and your goal is to get everything done. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

**Style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**List**: _Studies_

**Search term**: _none_

**Period**: _overall_

**Number**: _all_

**Depends on priority**: _Disabled_

### Example: Finish three to-dos per week of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _Studies_ and your goal is to work on these regularly: You want to get at least three to-dos done per week. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

**Style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**List**: _Studies_

**Search term**: _none_

**Period**: _current week_

**Number**: _3_

**Depends on priority**: _Disabled_

### Example: Read everyday

You're now maybe tempted to add a list _Reading_ to Apple Reminders and report on this, like we've done in the two examples above. But think about it for a second: If you add a list for each report, you might end up with tons of lists and things can get out of hand fairly quick.

That's why we use a different strategy this time: Let's define a _#read_ tag. Even though Apple Reminders does not support tags natively, we're still able to add them as simple text. Now, to track how your doing on your _#read_ tag, we add a report with the following settings:

**Style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**List**: _all_

**Search term**: _#read_

**Period**: _current week_

**Number**: _7_

**Depends on priority**: _Disabled_

## Stay engaged with the Today-Widget

To see the progress bar in the Today-Screen, make sure you've enabled "Show in Today-Widget" in your report configuration.
