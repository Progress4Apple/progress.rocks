## Preliminary notes

### Meant as an addition - not as a replacement

Please note Progress for Apple Reminders is not designed to replace the Apple Reminders stock app. It is designed to serve as a complementary tool which, once configured, helps you to stay on track. "Doing the work" still takes place in Apple Reminders.

### Display styles

In Progress for Apple Reminders you're able to choose between the display styles _progress_ and _remaining_. You can choose whichever you prefer.

#### Display style "progress"

The progress display style is based on what you already achieved. For example: If you have a total of six reminders in your _Studies_ list and two out of six are done, the report shows you a progress of 33% towards your goal:

#### Display style "remaining"

The remaining display style is based on what you still need to do. For example: If you have a total of six reminders in your _Studies_ list and two out of six are done, the report shows that there are 66% left until you reach your goal:

## 1. Let's start: Define your goals

The concept of "reaching goals" is at the heart of Progress for Apple Reminders. As a consequence the first step you need to do in order to make Progress for Apple Reminders actually useful is to define your goals.

### Here are some examples for such goals

• Finish all to-dos of a given project

• Finish three to-dos of a given project per week

• Read everyday

• ...

## 2. Create a report to track your progress

Once you defined your goals, it's time to add reports in Progress for Apple Reminders. You should add one report for each goal.

### Example: Finish all to-dos of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _Studies_ and your goal is to get everything done. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

**Display style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**Period**: _overall_

**List**: _Studies_

**Search term**: _none_

**Goal**: _all_

**Measured according to priority**: _Disabled_

### Example: Finish three to-dos per week of a given project

You have a bunch of stuff in the Apple Reminders list _Studies_ and your goal is to work on these regularly: You want to get at least three to-dos done per week. To track your progress add a report with the following settings:

**Display style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**Period**: _current week_

**List**: _Studies_

**Search term**: _none_

**Goal**: _3_

**Measured according to priority**: _Disabled_

### Example: Read everyday

You're now maybe tempted to add a list _Reading_ to Apple Reminders and report on this, like we've done in the two examples above. But think about it for a second: If you add a list for each report, you might end up with tons of lists and things can get out of hand fairly quick.

That's why we use a different strategy this time: Let's define a _#read_ tag. Even though Apple Reminders does not support tags natively, we're still able to add them as simple text. Now, to track how your doing on your _#read_ tag, we add a report with the following settings:

**Display style**: _personal taste (see preliminary notes above)_

**Period**: _current week_

**List**: _all_

**Search term**: _#read_

**Goal**: _7_

**Measured according to priority**: _Disabled_

## Stay engaged with Today-Widgets

To see the progress bars in the Today-Screen, the following conditions have to be met.

### In the report settings, make sure that:

**Period**: Is either _current week_, _last week_, _current month_, or _last month_.

**Show in Today-Widget**: Is _Enabled_.

### In case your report still doesn't appear in the Today-Widget

Please double check the report settings and make sure you've added the Today-Widget corresponding to the period chosen in the report. If the problem persists, please drop me a line at [support@progress.rocks](mailto:support@progress.rocks)

### Today-Widget for "overall" period

As of now there is no Today-Widget for the _overall_ period. This is due to the tight memory limits of Today-Widgets. I’m still testing if the Today-Widgets are guaranteed to work, even if there are tons of reminders in the Reminders app. If the overall Today-Widget is what you are looking for, [please drop me a line](mailto:support@progress.rocks) containing the approximately amount of reminders you add to Apple Reminders per week.

## Get creative

This guide should give you an idea of what's possible with Progress for Apple Reminders. Now start defining your goals, add reports and start beating the bar!
