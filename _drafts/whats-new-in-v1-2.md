The new version of Progress for Apple Reminders just left the building! This time it's a small one, where I focused primarily on one thing: Creating an App Review.

### Creating an App Review

I love to put you in charge to steer the direction of where Progress is heading. Thus, I wanted to make the conversation about the good, the bad and the ugly (if any) publicly available. By creating App Reviews, you can help any App Store Visitor to decide whether Progress is the right fit for their use case or not - and at the same time you're providing me useful insights about which features or bugs to tackle next!

### How it works

You can publish your opinion about Progress by **tapping "..." in the upper left corner and then "Review in App Store"**.

As long as you didn't create any App Review, Progress will request you to create one - but don't worry, it does it in a quite modest way. The request is displayed only if:

* you did not create an App Review yet
* and you are using Progress for more than five days
* and you worked already quite a bit with Progress
* and the last prompt is more than 100 days ago
