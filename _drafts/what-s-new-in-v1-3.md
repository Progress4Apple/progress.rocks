Hope you guys enjoyed the summer break! I absolutely did - and I also used my spare time to work on Progress. Today I'm able to share some exciting news with you!

### ðŸŒ“ Light Mode

As you might noticed, iOS as well as iPadOS 13 brings you a new and quite cool feature: [Dark Mode](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-dark-mode-in-ios-13/). Since Progress was already dark by default, I'm proud to welcome you on the bright side: Progress got an all new and shiny Light Mode! And guess what; Progress automatically switches between Light and Dark Mode depending on your system settings ðŸ¥³.

### ðŸ“± iPadOS

Another major improvement is the official support for iPadOS from this release on. So if you prefer to keep track of your achievements on your iPad - you now can!

### ðŸŒŸ _ProgressKit_ is now Open Source

Last but not least, I'm releasing the reporting engine of Progress as Open Source. It's the heart of Progress and contians nearly all logic and rendering functionality. The SDK is called _ProgressKit_ and is released under MIT License. That said, you are basically free to use it in any way you like. For example, if you want to build your own piece of Software which creates reports based on Apple Reminders - give it a shot! Further information is available on the [SDK's documentation](https://sdk.progress.rocks/) - just click "SDK" in the main navigation of the Progress website.

**Progress v1.3 - this is it. As always, if you have any question or feedback just drop me a line:** [**support@progress.rocks**](mailto:support@progress.rocks)

_If you use Apple Reminders to organise your to-do lists, Progress for Apple Reminders can help you to achieve what you want. Give it a try and let me know what you think!_
