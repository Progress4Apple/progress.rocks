Hope you all enjoyed the summer break! I absolutely did - but I also used the time share some exciting news with you today!

### üåì Light Mode

As you might noticed, iOS as well as iPadOS 13 come with a new and quite hyped feature: [Dark Mode](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-dark-mode-in-ios-13/). Since Progress was already dark by default, I'm somewhat proud to present the all new and shiny Light Mode! And before you ask, yes I've gone the extra mile: Progress automatically switches between Light and Dark Mode depending on your system settings ü•≥.

..... ZWEIGETEILTES BILD DARK/LIGHT MODE ...

iPadOS

Neither big bells and whistles nor new features this time. Just ordinary improvements. With this update it's safe to say we are fully in line with the [Zombieland rule #32: "Enjoy the little things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp2W0Lylzrs).

### üåü Swift 5

The upgrade to Swift 5 is undeniably the biggest change in this release. From a user perspective you won't notice any difference for now. Here's what Apple has to say about the benefits of Swift 5:

> ... the Swift runtime is now built into iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS ... Users who download an app built with Swift from the App Store will get a smaller app and a faster download. - [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

### üêû Delete confirmation when adding a report

Under certain circumstances a delete confirmation dialog was shown while the user was adding a report. Obviously this leads to a lot of confusion. This bug has been fixed.

### üêû Number as goal for report with "overall" period

If the user set a custom number as goal for a report with the "overall" period, the user defined number was ignored. Instead Progress wrongly calculated the score of all available reminders and assumed this is the goal the user wants to achieve. This behaviour has been fixed.
