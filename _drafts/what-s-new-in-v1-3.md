Hope you all enjoyed the summer break! I absolutely did - and I also used the time to work on Progress. Today I'm able to share some exciting news with you!

### ðŸŒ“ Light Mode

As you might noticed, iOS as well as iPadOS 13 come with a new and quite hyped feature: [Dark Mode](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-dark-mode-in-ios-13/). Since Progress was already dark by default, I'm somewhat proud to present the all new and shiny Light Mode! And before you ask, yes I've gone the extra mile: Progress automatically switches between Light and Dark Mode depending on your system settings ðŸ¥³.
