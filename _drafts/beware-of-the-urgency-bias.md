If you are serious about reaching your goals, you need to choose wisely whether something deserves your attention or not - otherwise you’ll get lost along the way.

> I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent. _- Dwight D. Eisenhower._

In today’s world it’s hard to focus on what really matters. Too much distractions crave for our attention. If you’ve ever set a goal for the day, but did not even start working on it, then you know exactly what I mean. Whether it’s your coworkers asking for your help, the breaking news on tv or this not new topic you follow on social media - all of this wants your attention and thus prevents you from reaching your goals.

To pave the way to your goals, you have to acknowledge that most things which appear important to you, are either _important for someone else_ or _massively overrated by yourself_ (aka. as the [mere urgency effect - a tendency to pursue urgency over importance](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jcr/ucy008/4847790)).

If you ever find yourself hunting one “important” task after another, do a re-evaluation of your tasks using the [Eisenhower Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method) and ask yourself: “What happens, if I simply don’t do this?” and “Is it worth the effort to avoid these things to happen?”

If you use Apple Reminders to organise your to-do lists, Progress for Apple Reminders can help you to achieve what you want. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
