Time to celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

Today Progress for Apple Reminders made it to the Apple App Store! It's now available for an affordable, one time purchase of $2.99.

I'd like to step back for a moment and thank all of you which made this release possible: Thank you, for all your feedback. Thank you, for all your ideas. Without your thoughts this wouldn't have been possible at all.

Especially, I'd like to thank all of you which gave the Beta version a test ride. Because of this, I prepared a little gift for you: You'll receive a promo code to download Progress for free. Even more, it allows you to download any future updates for free too. That said, you'll be able to use Progress without paying a dime - forever!

Thanks again, I', really enjoying having you on this journey.  
Marco
