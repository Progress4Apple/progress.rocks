In this post I'll show you how you can leverage the simplicity of Apple Reminders to get even more productive using the 1-3-5 rule. If you're not familiar with this rule yet, here's the gist:

> On any given day, assume that you can only accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and five small things, and narrow down your to-do list to those nine items. _-_ [_the muse_](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule)

In addition, the rule suggest to start your day with the 1 big thing - working towards 3 medium and 5 small things. This way you make sure you accomplish the most important task of the day first, thus avoid getting caught by the [urgency effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/smarter-living/eisenhower-box-productivity-tips.html).

### How to use priorities in Apple Reminders

To actually implement the rule, we need to segment your tasks in "big", "medium" and "small" things in Apple Reminders. To do so we leverage the reminder priority:

**Low (!)** - a "small" thing  
**Medium (!!)** - a "medium" thing  
**High (!!!)** - a "big" thing

How you actually decide what's "big", "medium" or "small" is up to you. Experience shows you should test the to-do against several criteria and choose it's belonging according to your gut's feeling:

* How much time does it cost you to get done?
* How much energy does it cost you to get it done?
* How big is the impact of the task once done?
* For how long are you finding excuses to not work on this item?
* _Insert your personal criteria here ..._

Of course the answers to these questions can change over time. That's why you should revise your todos regularly.

To sum up: We **use priorities together with the ability to set a date and time for the reminder** to end up with a **daily plan in the Scheduled list of Apple Reminders**.
