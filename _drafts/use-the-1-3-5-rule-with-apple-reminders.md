In this post I'll show you how you can leverage the simplicity of Apple Reminders to get even more productive using the 1-3-5 rule. If you're not familiar with this rule yet don't worry, here's the gist:

> On any given day, assume that you can only accomplish one big thing, three medium things, and five small things, and narrow down your to-do list to those nine items. _-_ [_the muse_](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-better-todo-list-the-135-rule)

In addition, the rule suggest to start your day with the chosen 1 big thing - working towards 3 medium and 5 small things. This way you make sure you accomplish the most important task of the day first, thus avoid getting caught by the [urgency effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/smarter-living/eisenhower-box-productivity-tips.html).

### How to use priorities in Apple Reminders

To actually implement the 1-3-5 rule, we need to flag our tasks as "big", "medium" or "small" in Apple Reminders. To do so we leverage the priority of the reminder:

**Low (!)** - a "small" thing  
**Medium (!!)** - a "medium" thing  
**High (!!!)** - a "big" thing

How you actually decide what's "big", "medium" or "small" is up to you. Experience shows you should test your to-dos against several criteria and choose their belonging according to your guts feeling:

* How much time does it costs you to get done?
* How much energy does it costs you to get done?
* How big is the impact of the task once done?
* For how long are you finding excuses and avoid working on this?
* _Insert your personal criteria here ..._

Of course the answers to these questions change over time. So you should revise your todos regularly.

To sum up: We **use priorities together with the ability to set a date and time for the reminder** to end up with a **daily plan in the Scheduled list of Apple Reminders**.
