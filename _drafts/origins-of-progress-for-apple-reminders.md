If you found Progress for Apple Reminders, chances are good you are already familiar with ["Getting Things Done" - David Allens Methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com) of how to appropriately get shit done. I'm a big fan of the core principles of this Methodology also known as  the [GTD Five Steps](https://gettingthingsdone.com/five-steps/).

What made a huge difference to me was Davids advice to "capture all the things ... in a logical and trusted system outside of your head" as well as "filing has to be instantaneous and easy".

Now, take on your Apple-Universe-Glasses and let's think about Davids advice for a second. Can you see it? Which App does fit this description?

Apple Reminders is the perfect match! It is a "trusted system outside of your head" and since it is available in nearly every macOS and iOS App through the Share Action, it is "instantaneous and easy" as well.
