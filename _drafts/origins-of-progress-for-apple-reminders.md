If you found Progress for Apple Reminders, chances are good you are already familiar with ["Getting Things Done" - David Allens Methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com) of how to appropriately get shit done. I'm a big fan of the core principles of this Methodology also known as  the [GTD Five Steps](https://gettingthingsdone.com/five-steps/).

What made a huge difference to me was Davids advice to "capture all the things ... in a logical and trusted system outside of your head" as well as "filing has to be instantaneous and easy".

Now, take on your Apple-Universe-Glasses and let's think about Davids advice for a second. Can you see it? Which App in the Apple universe does fit this description?

Exactly, Apple Reminders is the perfect match! It is a "trusted system outside of your head", it is available for all Apple platforms as well as in nearly every App through the Share Action - so one can safely say it is "instantaneous and easy".

That's why I keep track of everything in Apple Reminders - regardless if professional or private. Don't be misled: Apple Reminders isn't a project management software. It doesn't have a lot of features. But it does one thing extremely well: Keeping things simple. In 90% of all times I simply want to keep track of an idea which can be specified with a title, description, maybe a link - and be reminded of it at a specific location or time. That's it. And that's exactly where Apple Reminders excels.
