Big thanks to all Beta Testers for their testing effort. I got a lot of positive feedback as well as some criticism. This release is the first attempt blending your feedback into the  product.

_Here's what's new in v0.8.1_

### All new report form

The report form has an all new design. By providing a live preview on top and descriptions below each section the whole configuration experience became a whole lot better. You are now able to instantly see how the report is affected by each setting.

### All new Today-Widget

A lot of people were confused by the user experience of the app. I made a first attempt on improving this by adding an "Add" button on the report creation page in the upper right corner. This should make it easy now to understand how and when a newly created report is saved.
