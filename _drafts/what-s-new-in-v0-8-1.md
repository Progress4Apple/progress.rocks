I'm so happy to announce this release. It's the direct result of all your feedback and thoughts. I hope you like it as much as I do.

_Here's what's new in v0.8.1_

### All new report form

The report form has an all new design. By providing a live preview on top and descriptions below each section the whole configuration experience became a whole lot better. You are now able to instantly see how the report is affected by each setting.

### All new Today-Widget

My decision to create one Today-Widget for each period lead to a lot of confusion amongst users. In this release I'm addressing this issue with the all new "Status" Today-Widget. It's capable to show all of your reports within the same Today-Widget. Simply enable "Show in Today-Widget" in your report and add the "Status" Widget to the Today-Screen and you're all set. This even works for "overall" periods!
